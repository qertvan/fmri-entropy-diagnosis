# --- Core Web Application & Server ---
Flask==3.0.3      # Used in app.py to create the web server, handle requests, and return JSON responses.

# --- Data Handling & Scientific Computing ---
numpy==1.26.4     # Essential in all scripts for the fundamental numerical data structure (arrays) and mathematical operations.
pandas==2.2.2     # Used in the fMRI processing pipeline and entropy calculation, especially for reading and managing .tsv and .csv files.
scipy==1.13.1     # Used in fmri_processing.py for interpolating data to fill gaps created after scrubbing noisy timepoints.

# --- fMRI Data Analysis & Neuroimaging ---
nilearn==0.10.4   # The central library in fmri_processing.py and entropy_calculator.py for processing, cleaning, and filtering fMRI data and extracting ROI time-series.
nibabel==5.2.1    # A core dependency for nilearn that provides the ability to read and write neuroimaging file formats like .nii.gz.
antropy==0.1.9 # Used in entropy_calculator.py to compute various entropy metrics, such as sample entropy, on time-series data.
